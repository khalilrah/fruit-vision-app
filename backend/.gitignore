# AI Models (Important! Decide how to handle these)
# If your models are SMALL (e.g., under 20MB total), you can REMOVE the next two lines
# to include them in your GitHub repository.
# If they are LARGE, keep these lines to ignore them, and you'll need to
# provide download instructions or use Git LFS (more advanced).
# For now, let's assume you might want to ignore them if they are large.
